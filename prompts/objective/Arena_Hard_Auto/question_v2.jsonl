You can perform the following operation at most once: Pick two cards and swap them. Is it possible to arrange the row as abc after the operation? Output 'YES' if it is possible, and 'NO' otherwise. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 6) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of the three characters a, b, and c exactly once, representing the cards. Output For each test case, output 'YES' if you can arrange the row as abc with at most one operation, or 'NO' otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings 'yEs', 'yes', 'Yes', and 'YES' will be recognized as a positive answer). Example inputCopy 6 abc acb bac bca cab cba outputCopy YES YES YES NO NO YES Note In the first test case, no operations are needed since the row is already abc. In the second test case, we can swap c and b: acb → abc. In the third test case, we can swap b and a: bac → abc. In the fourth test case, it is impossible to arrange as abc using at most one operation."}]}

Input Parameters: HMAC requires two inputs: a secret key (K) and the message or data (M) that needs to be authenticated. Additionally, it needs a cryptographic hash function (H), such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.\n2. Key Padding: If needed, the secret key (K) is padded or truncated to match the block size of the hash function (typically 512 bits for SHA-2).\n3. Inner Padding: XOR (exclusive OR) operations are performed on the padded key (K) with two fixed values known as the inner and outer padding constants (ipad and opad). These constants are specific to the HMAC algorithm.\n   • ipad is used to XOR with the key before hashing.\n   • opad is used to XOR with the key after hashing.\n4. Inner Hash: The inner padding (ipad XOR K) is concatenated with the message (M), and this combined value is hashed using the chosen hash function (H). This produces an intermediate hash result, denoted as H(ipad XOR K || M).\n5. Outer Hash: The outer padding (opad XOR K) is concatenated with the intermediate hash result from the previous step (H(ipad XOR K || M)), and this combined value is hashed again using the same hash function (H). This final hash operation yields the HMAC, represented as H(opad XOR K || H(ipad XOR K || M)).\n6. HMAC Output: The output of the second hash operation is the HMAC, a fixed-size value that can be appended to the message to create a MAC. Based on the above, explain about HMAC."}]}

More perplexed than ever, you still go inside. After glaring at you for some time, she looks into her crystal ball, which has a strange glow, and says in a mysterious voice:\n• You have a dog.\n• The person you are looking for buys carrots by the bushel.\n• Anyone who owns a rabbit hates anything that chases any rabbit.\n• Every dog chases some rabbit.\n• Anyone who buys carrots by the bushel owns either a rabbit or a grocery store.\n• Someone who hates something owned by another person will not date that person.\nThe sentences you just heard remind you of a person: Robin. But before you leave, she challenges you with a conclusion:\n• If the person you are looking for does not own a grocery store, she will not date you.\nRemembering the sentence at the entrance, you realize that what she has told you is true only if you can prove her challenging conclusion.

Visit www.DeepL.com/pro for more information. How are our historic stone houses built and what problems do stone structures face today? I have been trying to read up on natural stone masonry, and in particular trying to find examples of constructions where both natural stone and brick have been used in the same construction. The overwhelming majority of our historic buildings are in stone, and not infrequently they have, if not entire walls of natural stone, then at least elements of natural stone. The focus of this compilation has been to read about a wide range of topics in the field of natural stone masonry, but perhaps the most focus has been on craft processes and descriptions of approaches to the material. Which stone is used where varies greatly from place to place, so the magnifying glass has also ended up reading about the difference in materials across the country, as well as the problems we face in the conservation and restoration of natural stone structures today. Natural stone is a material that has historically been used in Sweden since before the advent of bricks. Our early stone buildings were built by cold masonry where stones were stacked on top of each other without the use of mortar or other binders. However, natural stone has had difficulty asserting itself in buildings outside of high-rise buildings such as churches, manor houses and mansions, partly because of the ingrained tradition of building residential buildings in wood, but also because it was an expensive material, both in terms of transportation if the material was not close at hand, but also in terms of processing. In 1766, at a time when there was a shortage of wood for building houses, and even a promise of a 20-year tax exemption if you built your house in stone, Carl Wijnblad writes about how natural stone was difficult to handle and unsuitable for building houses. Here, however, he is talking about natural stone in the form of gray stone, a collective term for blocks of stone picked directly from the ground or dug up, for example, during agricultural work, and not about the brick, which he warmly advocated in his book Beskrifning, huru allmogens buildings, so of stone, as well as trees, must be erected with the greatest economy, according to attached project drawings in six copper pieces, as well as proposals for necessary building materials. He found the stone unsuitable as it requires a lot of processing and a lot of lime to be good enough to be used other than for foundation walls and cellars. The stone was also considered to be damp and cold, and suitable only for animal houses. Buildings made of both natural stone, in the form of grey stone, and brick in the same construction are described in a number of different designs in the training material from Hermods in the document Byggnadskonstruktionslära (för murare) : undervisning per korrespondens (1907). In the chapter Walls of stone blocks: \"Such walls of stone blocks, which are to have any appreciable height, are, however, erected as mixed walls, i.e. they are erected with horizontal bands and vertical columns of brick\". This also clarifies several other approaches to the inclusion of bricks in natural stone walls, with bricks or more tumbled stones being used in virtually all parts of the wall where greater precision is required. Window surrounds, the corners of the wall, the above-mentioned stabilizing shifts, and even roof ends should be made of brick. Hermod's text is relatively exhaustive in the field of natural stone masonry, and describes various approaches to stones in differently worked conditions, but no information about who or where these experiences and approaches come from is given in the text. The text is familiarly signed by Hermods himself, but it is doubtful that he is the author. Further reading in, for example, Arvid Henström's book Landtbyggnadskonsten volume 5 (1869) offers a slightly more detailed account of the building method, but in general the advice sounds the same as in Hermod's text. As an engineer, Henström should be well versed in the art of building, and his recommendations are sound, even if the text itself is not significantly exhaustive in terms of illustrations or other aids other than a running text description of different approaches to masonry with natural stone. The fact that someone like Henström is giving the same advice as Hermods gives good credit to the fact that the information in the training material is sound and well based on literature in the field. However, Henström makes it clear already in the introduction to this text that it is not written for the experienced craftsman, but \"it is intended for the farmer and his inexperienced workers who are unfamiliar with building details and their form and execution\", which explains the lack of drawing examples and more detailed descriptions of the craft processes. Both texts recommend the use of the best quality hydraulic lime mortar for masonry. One conclusion to be drawn from reading both Hermod's and Henström's texts is that the construction of a stone wall does not differ so dramatically, whether it is built of brick or natural stone. The goal is to achieve a joint where the different building blocks interact with each other to create a stable structure that can withstand forces from different directions, but different solutions need to be applied depending on how processed the stones are. Both provide insight into the role that brick can play in natural stone construction, and are described as the rational choice in many cases. Neither text is exhaustive, or should be seen as detailed descriptions of craft processes, but they can be used, with a little prior knowledge, as a complement to the execution of masonry with natural stone. Structures using relatively unprocessed natural stone face a number of problems in addition to those encountered during construction. The Geological Society London publishes a journal that compiles information and articles in the field. The journal itself is locked behind fees, but the introduction was available for guidance to other authors in the field. The introduction is written by Professor of Geology Siegesmund Siegfried, who in his text highlights the problems faced in the preservation and restoration of natural stone buildings. Strategies on how to deal with damage caused by natural degradation of the stone, how the environment influences the grading, how anthropogenic circumstances accelerate decay, attack by algae or microorganisms in the stone. The reading of Siegesmund's text therefore led me on a trail of other texts in the field, and eventually to the article Impact of the surface roughness of stones used in historical buildings on biodeterioration, a text on how the surface texture porosity of building stones influences the speed and degree of biological impact and degradation. Biological impact refers to plants, both clinging plants with roots and creeping plants such as lichens and mosses, and their impact on the structure of the stone, both as living and dead material. The material is based on investigations carried out in Nigde, Turkey, which is somewhat different from conditions in Sweden, but the different types of rocks investigated are similar to those used in Sweden, such as large amounts of limestone.

I can wait for 10 years in both cases. Buying a flat involves: 1) Taking a loan of 80 lakhs and paying an EMI of around 80,000 per month for 15 years or until I foreclose it. 2) Flat construction will take 2 years and will not give me any rent during that time. 3) After 2 years, I might get rent in the range of 20,000-30,000 per month. 4) There is a risk that tenants might spoil the flat and may not pay rent. 5) I might have to invest 30,000 every year for repairs. 6) If it is not rented, I need to pay a maintenance amount of 60,000 per year; if it is rented, then the tenants will take care of the maintenance. 7) After 5-6 years, the value of the flat might be 2x and after 10 years, it might become 2.5x. 8) After 10 years, when I sell the flat, I need to pay 20% capital gains tax on the capital gains. In case I do SIP in Indian mutual funds, these are the considerations: a) I intend to put 1 lakh per month in a large-cap fund, 1 lakh per month in a small-cap fund, and 1 lakh per month in a mid-cap fund. I will do SIP until I exhaust all 90 lakhs and then wait for it to grow. b) Large-cap funds grow at 7-8% per annum generally and by 1-2% per annum in bad years. c) Small-cap funds grow at 15-20% per annum in good years and -15% to -30% per annum during bad years. d) Mid-caps grow at 10-15% per annum in good years and go down by 10-15% per annum in bad years.

For reliable email operation and to avoid being blocked, I need a static public IP address. Unfortunately, I can't obtain a static IP from my ISP or switch ISPs at the moment.\n\nI've found a solution to purchase a 4G SIM card with a static IP from an ISP, which I can use with a USB dongle. However, this 4G connection is costly per MB.\n\nSince only the email server requires a static IP, I can use my home network for everything else, updating DNS records with DDNS, which has worked for other services.\n\nMy question is: Is it theoretically possible to connect the server to two network interfaces simultaneously and route traffic based on destination port? Specifically, I want all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 to use the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections to go through eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on these ports on enx344b50000000 and on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.\n\nI would need DNS records for mail.mydomain.tld -> <4g static public IP> and mydomain.tld -> <home public IP> (updated with DDNS and NAT configured on my home router).\n\nThis setup should allow seamless connections to these two IP addresses without users realizing they are the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are on the specified ports.\n\nIs this possible? Could it be a robust solution? Can someone help me set it up?\n\nI've found various guides through DuckDuckGo, and I understand it involves setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However, I haven't managed to make it work, and the guides I've found differ slightly and often pertain to VPNs. Can anyone assist with my specific use case?"}]}

The invention pertains to a system for detecting undercurrent faults in heated grips for a two-wheeled vehicle without the need for a current sensor. 'Existing hardware does not have the capability to sense the current to trigger an undercurrent fault. The Master ECU sends a command to the Slave ECU to initiate heating of the coil. Upon receiving this command, the Slave ECU starts generating a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to heat the coil and begins reading the temperature sensor. The coil, while heating the element, consumes a significant amount of current. Ideally, there should be a direct provision from the hardware to sense the actual current consumption and provide this information to the microcontroller. Based on this information, the microcontroller can decide whether to set an undercurrent fault or not. However, in the existing hardware setup, there is no provision to sense the current. Adding this current sensing hardware to the existing product will attract additional costs and complexities in further component arrangements of the product. Existing solutions may use a current sensor or a shunt resistor to measure the actual current consumption of the coil and compare it with a threshold value. Based on these parameters, undercurrent detection can be easily done. However, this solution would require additional hardware components, which would increase the cost and complexity of the system. Moreover, the current sensor or the shunt resistor could introduce noise or interference in the PWM signal, affecting the heating performance of the coil.'"}]}

the container at http://localhost:3838/:\n\nI make app.R file in the package directory. the content of the app.R is:\n# app.R\nsource(\"server.R\")\nsource(\"ui.R\")\n#also copy it to inst/metfamily\n\nAlso I make an run_profvis.R file in the package directury. the content of the run_profvis.R is:: \n#

Provide well-reasoned arguments and examples to support your assessment. Consider the implications of this methodology for different age groups and educational levels. Additionally, discuss the balance between the emphasis on proper language mechanics and the potential limitations on creativity in language expression. Ensure that your response reflects a deep understanding of the structural view of language and its implications for English language teaching. In a critical analysis, compare and contrast the Direct Method and the Grammar-Translation Method. Identify and discuss the key principles that differentiate these two language teaching methods. Additionally, evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching techniques associated with each method. Support your analysis with examples and consider the implications of these methods on language acquisition and proficiency. In light of the historical context and critiques discussed in the Audio Lingual Method, evaluate critically the reasons behind the decline in popularity of the Audio-lingual Method. Provide specific examples of criticisms and discuss how the method's theoretical foundations contributed to its diminished use in language teaching. Considering the evolution of language teaching methods discussed in the course of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT), analyze critically the central concept of 'communicative competence' in CLT. Discuss how CLT addresses the limitations of previous methods and evaluate the role of learners and teachers in the CLT approach."}]}
