You are allowed to perform the following operation at most once: Select two cards and swap their positions. Can the row be rearranged to abc after this operation? Print \\\"YES\\\" if it's possible, and \\\"NO\\\" otherwise. Input The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤6) — the number of test cases. The only line of each test case contains a single string consisting of each of the three characters a, b, and c exactly once, representing the cards. Output For each test case, output \\\"YES\\\" if you can make the row abc with at most one operation, or \\\"NO\\\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings \\\"yEs\\\", \\\"yes\\\", \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"YES\\\" will be recognized as a positive answer). Example inputCopy 6 abc acb bac bca cab cba outputCopy YES YES YES NO NO YES Note In the first test case, we don't need to do any operations, since the row is already abc. In the second test case, we can swap c and b: acb→abc. In the third test case, we can swap b and a: bac→abc. In the fourth test case, it is impossible to make abc using at most one operation."}]}

This is to hold true regardless of the specific values of the toys. Let v_i represent the value of the i-th toy and S be a binary string where S_i = 1 indicates the toy is for Alice and S_i = 0 for Bob.

Additionally, it requires a cryptographic hash function (H), such as SHA-256 or SHA-3.\n2.Key Padding: If necessary, the secret key (K) is padded or truncated to match the block size of the hash function (typically 512 bits for SHA-2).\n3.Inner Padding: XOR (exclusive OR) operations are performed on the padded key (K) with two fixed values known as the inner and outer padding constants (ipad and opad). These constants are specific to the HMAC algorithm.\nipad is used to XOR with the key before hashing.\nopad is used to XOR with the key after hashing.\n4.Inner Hash: The inner padding (ipad XOR K) is concatenated with the message (M), and this combined value is hashed using the chosen hash function (H). This produces an intermediate hash result, denoted as H(ipad XOR K || M).\n5.Outer Hash: The outer padding (opad XOR K) is concatenated with the intermediate hash result from the previous step (H(ipad XOR K || M)), and this combined value is hashed again using the same hash function (H). This final hash operation yields the HMAC, represented as H(opad XOR K || H(ipad XOR K || M)).\nHMAC Output: The output of the second hash operation is the HMAC, which is a fixed-size value that can be appended to the message to create a MAC.\nExplain the process of generating an HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code), including input parameters, key padding, inner padding, inner hash, outer hash, and the resulting HMAC output."}]}

Visit www.DeepL.com/pro for more information.\nHow are our historic stone houses built and what problems do stone structures face today?\nI have been trying to read up on natural stone masonry, and in particular trying to find examples of constructions where both natural stone and brick have been used in the same construction. The overwhelming majority of our historic buildings are in stone, and not infrequently they have, if not entire walls of natural stone, then at least elements of natural stone.\nThe focus of this compilation has been to read about a wide range of topics in the field of natural stone masonry, but perhaps the most focus has been on craft processes and descriptions of approaches to the material.\nWhich stone is used where varies greatly from place to place, so the magnifying glass has also ended up reading about the difference in materials across the country, as well as the problems we face in the conservation and restoration of natural stone structures today.\nNatural stone is a material that has historically been used in Sweden since before the advent of bricks. Our early stone buildings were built by cold masonry where stones were stacked on top of each other without the use of mortar or other binders.\nHowever, natural stone has had difficulty asserting itself in buildings outside of high-rise buildings such as churches, manor houses and mansions, partly because of the ingrained tradition of building residential buildings in wood, but also because it was an expensive material, both in terms of transportation if the material was not close at hand, but also in terms of processing.\nIn 1766, at a time when there was a shortage of wood for building houses, and even a promise of a 20-year tax exemption if you built your house in stone, Carl Wijnblad writes about how natural stone was difficult to handle and unsuitable for building houses. Here, however, he is talking about natural stone in the form of gray stone, a collective term for blocks of stone picked directly from the ground or dug up, for example, during agricultural work, and not about the brick, which he warmly advocated in his book Beskrifning, huru allmogens buildings, so of stone, as well as trees, must be erected with the greatest economy, according to attached project drawings in six copper pieces, as well as proposals for necessary building materials. He found the stone unsuitable as it requires a lot of processing and a lot of lime to be good enough to be used other than for foundation walls and cellars. The stone was also considered to be damp and cold, and suitable only for animal houses.\nBuildings made of both natural stone, in the form of grey stone, and brick in the same construction are described in a number of different designs in the training material from Hermods in the document Byggnadskonstruktionslära (för murare) : undervisning per korrespondens (1907). In the chapter Walls of stone blocks: \"Such walls of stone blocks, which are to have any appreciable height, are, however, erected as mixed walls, i.e. they are erected with horizontal bands and vertical columns of brick\". This also clarifies several other\napproaches to the inclusion of bricks in natural stone walls, with bricks or more tumbled stones being used in virtually all parts of the wall where greater precision is required. Window surrounds, the corners of the wall, the above-mentioned stabilizing shifts, and even roof ends should be made of brick. Hermod's text is relatively exhaustive in the field of natural stone masonry, and describes various approaches to stones in differently worked conditions, but no information about who or where these experiences and approaches come from is given in the text. The text is familiarly signed by Hermods himself, but it is doubtful that he is the author.\nFurther reading in, for example, Arvid Henström's book Landtbyggnadskonsten volume 5 (1869) offers a slightly more detailed account of the building method, but in general the advice sounds the same as in Hermod's text. As an engineer, Henström should be well versed in the art of building, and his recommendations are sound, even if the text itself is not significantly exhaustive in terms of illustrations or other aids other than a running text description of different approaches to masonry with natural stone.\nThe fact that someone like Henström is giving the same advice as Hermods gives good credit to the fact that the information in the training material is sound and well based on literature in the field.\nHowever, Henström makes it clear already in the introduction to this text that it is not written for the experienced craftsman, but \"it is intended for the farmer and his inexperienced workers who are unfamiliar with building details and their form and execution\", which explains the lack of drawing examples and more detailed descriptions of the craft processes. Both texts recommend the use of the best quality hydraulic lime mortar for masonry.\nOne conclusion to be drawn from reading both Hermod's and Henström's texts is that the construction of a stone wall does not differ so dramatically, whether it is built of brick or natural stone. The goal is to achieve a joint where the different building blocks interact with each other to create a stable structure that can withstand forces from different directions, but different solutions need to be applied depending on how processed the stones are. Both provide insight into the role that brick can play in natural stone construction, and are described as the rational choice in many cases. Neither text is exhaustive, or should be seen as detailed descriptions of craft processes, but they can be used, with a little prior knowledge, as a complement to the execution of masonry with natural stone.\nStructures using relatively unprocessed natural stone face a number of problems in addition to those encountered during construction.\nThe Geological Society London publishes a journal that compiles information and articles in the field. The journal itself is locked behind fees, but the introduction was available for guidance to other authors in the field. The introduction is written by Professor of Geology Siegesmund Siegfried, who in his text highlights the problems faced in the preservation and restoration of natural stone buildings. Strategies on how to deal with damage caused by natural degradation of the stone, how the environment influences the grading, how anthropogenic circumstances accelerate decay, attack by algae or microorganisms in the stone.\nThe reading of Siegesmund's text therefore led me on a trail of other texts in the field, and eventually to the article Impact of the surface roughness of stones used in historical buildings on biodeterioration, a text on how the surface texture porosity of building stones influences the speed and degree of biological impact and degradation.\n\nBiological impact refers to plants, both clinging plants with roots and creeping plants such as lichens and mosses, and their impact on the structure of the stone, both as living and dead material. The material is based on investigations carried out in Nigde, Turkey, which is somewhat different from conditions in Sweden, but the different types of rocks investigated are similar to those used in Sweden, such as large amounts of limestone. The source is really only tangentially relevant to this compilation, but interesting reading nonetheless, and definitely a recurring topic in the question of how our stone houses should be taken care of.\nSources\n● Henström, Arvid (1869) Practical handbook in the art of rural construction: including the study of building materials, the processing and joining of building materials, the shape, dimensions and strength of building components ....

Since email servers require a stable public IP address to avoid being blocked, and I can't secure a static IP from my current ISP or switch providers, I'm considering using a 4G SIM card with a static IP. This solution involves significant data costs. My plan is to use this static IP solely for email-related traffic, while employing DDNS for other services with my regular home network. The setup I'm contemplating involves connecting my server to two network interfaces: routing all traffic related to email (ports 25, 465, 587, possibly 993) through the 4G dongle (interface enx344b50000000), and other traffic through the standard home network interface (eth0). I would configure DNS so that mail.mydomain.tld points to the 4G IP, and mydomain.tld to my home IP updated via DDNS. Ideally, this would allow seamless internet access to both IPs without revealing they're hosted on the same server. My question is: Is such a configuration feasible? Could it provide a reliable solution as intended? Additionally, could I receive guidance on setting it up, considering I've struggled with iptables and IP route settings based on various online tutorials?"}]}

The invention pertains to a system designed to detect undercurrent faults in heated grips for two-wheeled vehicles without employing a current sensor. The current setup lacks hardware to measure current for triggering undercurrent faults. The Master ECU instructs the Slave ECU to heat the coil, which then generates a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal and monitors the temperature sensor. As the coil heats up, it draws significant current, which ideally would be directly monitored by the hardware to inform the microcontroller's fault detection decisions. However, the existing hardware does not support current measurement, and integrating such functionality would increase costs and complicate the design. Current solutions might use a current sensor or shunt resistor to monitor coil current against a threshold, facilitating undercurrent detection. Yet, these components could raise the system's cost, complexity, and potentially degrade performance by introducing noise or interference in the PWM signal."}]}

container:\ndocker run -p 3838:3838 sneumann/metfamily:latest\n#Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3838/\n\nI am using the following strategy to access the log of shiny app running in the container at http://localhost:3838/:\n\nI make app.R file in the package directory. the content of the app.R is:\n# app.R\nsource(\"server.R\")\nsource(\"ui.R\")\n#also copy it to inst/metfamily\n\nAlso I make an run_profvis.R file in the package directury. the content of the run_profvis.R is:: \n# run_profvis.R\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(profvis)\n#\nsetwd(\"/tmp/MetFamily/inst/MetFamily\")  # Set the correct path to your Shiny app directory in the container\n#\n# Define the Shiny application by

I've successfully set up and launched the app using Docker and have implemented logging via an app.R file and performance profiling with a run_profvis.R file in the package directory. However, I am uncertain about how to view the logs and the details of the R code executing in real-time within the container. Could you guide me on how to monitor all R code operations as they occur in real-time in the MetFamily Shiny web app running in the Docker container?"}]}

Upon correctness, the game master will furnish them with the subsequent riddle or the ultimate solution. Conversely, if a riddle remains unsolved, the game master will provide feedback and afford the player an opportunity for another attempt. Players have an unlimited number of tries to solve each riddle. It is imperative that the final solution remains undisclosed until all riddles are successfully solved. Now, onto the riddles: (1) Arrange a set of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm. What is the sequence in the penultimate step before the algorithm completes sorting? (2) Convert a binary numeral into its decimal equivalent. (3) Players must locate an object in the physical realm and identify the word inscribed on it. The game master is aware that the word is 'Sheep'. After these four riddles, players will receive the ultimate solution, comprising the following sequence of alphanumeric characters: 'AB154, HF879'"}]}
